## MCMC algorithm

Adopted from Yang 2014

1. Start with random (unrooted or ultrametric) tree T with set of branch length.
    better start with fastME or UPGMA / WPGMA tree
    coalescentMCMC
2. Iterate the following steps:
    a. Propose tree rearrangement
        start with NNI from colaescentMCMC
    b. Propose changes to edge weights
        sliding window??
    c. Propose changes to substitution parameter (bf and Q)
        bf (TODO) dirichlet
        Q (TODO) dirichlet
    d. Propose changes to gamma rate or invariant sites
    e. Every k iteration, sample the chain save tree and parameters
3. At the end summarize results
