## MCMC algorithm

phangornMCMC is implements several Bayesian phylogenetics in R. It is a branch 
of coalescentMCMC of Emmanual Paradis. The implementation is rather inefficient 
and slow and does not target to compete for speed with other MCMC software like 
RevBayes, MrBayes, BPP or BEAST. It is targeted for teaching purposes.   

Adopted from Yang 2014

1. Start with random (unrooted or ultrametric) tree T with set of branch length.
    better start with fastME or UPGMA / WPGMA tree
    coalescentMCMC
2. Iterate the following steps:
    a. Propose tree rearrangement
        start with NNI from colaescentMCMC
    b. Propose changes to edge weights
        sliding window?? (TODO)
    c. Propose changes to substitution parameter (bf and Q)
        bf (TODO) dirichlet
        Q (TODO) dirichlet
    d. Propose changes to gamma rate or invariant sites
    e. Every k iteration, sample the chain save tree and parameters
3. At the end summarize results



## Priors for the different parameters 

| Data type   | State frequencies | Substitution rates |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------| 
| Nucleotides | fixed / estimated | fixed / estimated  |
|             | (Dirichlet)       | (Dirichlet)        |
